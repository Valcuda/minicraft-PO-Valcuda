# Minicraft PO Valcuda
## About
This is a fork of Minicraft Plus Online.
It's really only intended for me and my friends to play, featuring some custom mods, and textures and crud.

**THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MINICRAFT+ SERVERS**
Currently, there is nothing stopping you from joining a Minicraft+ server, however, just because you *can*, doesn't mean you *should.*
I don't know what'd happen if you did, but I'm sure it'd be bad!

Despite this, you *do* have to make an account on [The Minicraft Website](https://playminicraft.com/) to play on a server. I'll try changing this in the future, since I'm unsure if the person hosting it cares or not, and I don't want to take that risk XD
For now tho, you'll need an account on that.

##Plans
My plan is to keep this up to date with Minicraft+ Online, and by extension, Minicraft+.
I also plan to add my own content obviously, along with changing things I don't really like.
